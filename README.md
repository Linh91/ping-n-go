This is an events program which searches a user's location and returns a list of the closest event with the cheapest tickets.
 
*Techonologies used: Node.js, Express, Mocha*

### Program scenario

- This program randomly generates seed data 
- This program operates in a world that ranges from -10 to +10 (Y axis), and -10 to +10 (X axis)
- Each co-ordinate can hold a maximum of one event
- Event event has a unique numeric identifier
- Each event has zero or more tickets
- Each ticket has a non-zero price ($)
- The distance between two points should be computed as the Manhattan distance

### How to get started

<code> git clone https://github.com/Linh91/ping-n-go.git </code> <br>
<code> npm install </code><br>
<code> node app.js </code><br>
<code>$ Example app listening on port 3000! </code><br>
Direct to: http://localhost:3000/

### How to run test 

### Example of program run

### How might you change your program if you needed to support multiple events at the same location?

### How would you change your program if you were working with a much larger world size?
